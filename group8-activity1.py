group 8
Done by Khaled Abusharbain (contribution: hexagon shape, pattern function, main function),
 zarak khan(square function shape), nour abdelwahed  (circle function)
 This module code has multiple functions with 3 different shapes to create a pattern of 3 shapes , it allows the user to choose his own shape color 
 and border.
